# Integration Guide

## Generic MQTT Server

You can integrate with generic MQTT server (message broker), e.g. the
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/mqtt.html) or
[Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org).

First of all, make sure you understand the
[terminology and principles of messaging](http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-php.html)
and that the MQTT protocol [is enabled](https://www.rabbitmq.com/mqtt.html)
in your broker.

Open the lorawan-server web-administration and create a Backend Connector:
 * *URI* defines the target host either as `mqtt://host:port` or `mqtts://host:port`
 * *Published Topic* is a pattern for constructing the message topic
   of uplinks, e.g. `out/{devaddr}`.
 * *Subscribe* is a downlink topic to be subscribed by the lorawan-server,
   e.g. `in/#`.
 * *Received Topic* is a template for parsing the topic of received downlink
   messages, e.g. `in/{devaddr}`.

On the Authentication tab:
 * *Auth* shall be set to *Username+Password*, even when the *Name* and
   *Password/Key* are empty.

In order to consume the uplink messages sent by your devices you have to subscribe
at the message broker for the *Published Topic*, e.g. for `out/#` (or even just `#`) by:
```bash
mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -t 'out/#' -u 'user' -P 'pass'
```

When using RabbitMQ, create a queue and then bind it to the `amq.topic` exchange
using the `out.#` (or `#`) binding key. Note that while MQTT uses slashes ("/") for
topic segment separators, RabbitMQ uses dots. RabbitMQ internally translates the two,
so for example the MQTT topic `cities/london` becomes in RabbitMQ `cities.london`.

To send a downlink message to one of your devices do e.g.
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -t 'in/00112233' -m '{"data":"00"}' -u 'user' -P 'pass'
```


## AWS IoT

Amazon Web Services (AWS) can be integrated via MQTT. All Nodes can share the same
connection to the server.

First, follow the AWS IoT guidelines to configure your IoT device:
 * Create and activiate a Security Certificate. Make sure you download the certificate
   (`xxx-certificate.pem.crt`) as well as the private key (`xxx-private.pem.key`).
 * Create a policy and link it to the certificate. For example, to allow
   all actions you can set:
   ```
   "Statement": [{
     "Action": "iot:*",
     "Resource": "*",
     "Effect": "Allow"
   }]
   ```
 * Create a device and link it to the same certificate.

Then, open the lorawan-server web-administration and create an Backend Connector:
 * *URI* is the AWS *Endpoint* with the `mqtts://` prefix
 * *Published Topic* is a pattern for the publication topic, e.g. `out/{devaddr}`.
 * *Subscribe* is a topic to be subscribed by the lorawan-server, e.g. `in/#`.
 * *Received Topic* is a template for parsing the topic of received messages, e.g. `in/{devaddr}`.

On the Authentication tab:
 * *Client ID* is the AWS *Account Id*
 * *Auth* shall be set to *Username+Password*
 * *User Certificate* is the `xxx-certificate.pem.crt` file you downloaded
 * *Private Key* is the `xxx-private.pem.key` file

Instead of creating a Security Certificate and then attaching it to the Thing
you can alternatively create a Thing Security Certificate. In such case the
*Client ID* shall be the Thing name.


## IBM Watson IoT Platform

IBM Watson IoT Platform can be integrated via MQTT. The lorawan-server can act
as a Gateway acting on behalf of multiple devices.

First, follow the IBM Bluemix documentation to configure the IoT Gateway:
 * Create a *device type* for your devices, e.g. "loramote"
 * Create a *gateway type* for the lorawan-server, e.g. "loraserver"
 * Create one gateway of the *gateway type* you just created using an arbitrary
   *Device ID*. After you click **Add** don't close the web-page displaying the
   auto-generated *Authentication Token*.
 * Do not create any devices; these will be created automatically once they send
   some data.

Then, open the lorawan-server web-administration and create an Backend Connector:
 * *URI* shall be `mqtt://orgid.messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com`, where
   orgid is your *Organization ID* displayed on the web-page you didn't close.
 * *Published Topic* is a pattern for the publication topic,
   e.g. `iot-2/type/loramote/id/{deveui}/evt/status/fmt/json`, where loramote is
   the *device type* you created.
 * *Subscribe* is a topic to be subscribed by the lorawan-server,
   e.g. `iot-2/type/loramote/id/+/cmd/+/fmt/+`.
 * *Received Topic* is a template for parsing the topic of received messages,
   e.g. `iot-2/type/loramote/id/{deveui}/cmd/status/fmt/json`.

On the Authentication tab:
 * *Client ID* shall be `g:orgid:loraserver:test`, where orgid is the *Organization ID*,
   loraserver is *gateway type* you created and test is the gateway *Device ID*.
 * *Auth* shall be set to *Username+Password*
 * *Name* shall always be `use-token-auth`
 * *Password/Key* is the gateway *Authentication Token* displayed on the page you
   didn't close.


## MathWorks ThingSpeak

MathWorks ThingSpeak can be integrated via MQTT. It supports only publishing to
channels using MQTT, subscriptions are not supported by ThingSpeak.

First, follow the ThingSpeak guidelines and create a New Channel:
 * Set a channel *Name*;
 * Define one or more *Field* labels;
 * Once you *Save Channel*, display the *Write API Key*.

Open the lorawan-server web-administration and create an Backend Connector:
 * *URI* shall be either `mqtt://mqtt.thingspeak.com` or `mqtts://mqtt.thingspeak.com`
 * *Published Topic* shall be `channels/<channelID>/publish/<apikey>`, where
   * `<channelID>` is the numeric *Channel ID*
   * `<apikey>` is the *Write API Key*
 * *Subscribe* and *Received Topic* shall be left empty.

Then, create a new Handler:
 * *Group* shall correspond to a Group attribute of some [Nodes](Nodes.md).
 * *Format* shall be *Web Form*.
 * *Parse Uplink* shall include a data parsing function. See the [Backends](Backends.md)
   guide for more information, but make sure the values are named "field1", "field2" etc.
 * *Connector* shall link to the Backend Connector you just created.

For example, a *Parse Uplink* for the Semtech LoRaMote could be:
```erlang
fun(_Port, <<LED, Press:16, Temp:16, AltBar:16, Batt, Lat:24, Lon:24, AltGps:16>>) ->
  #{field1 => LED, field2 => Press, field3 => Temp/100, field4 => AltBar, field5 => Batt}
end.
```

## Microsoft Azure IoT Hub

Microsoft Azure IoT Hub can be integrated via MQTT. Azure uses per-device credentials
so you cannot connect multiple devices (each with its own credentials) using the
same connection. A dedicated Connector is needed for each Node.

First, follow the Azure guidelines to configure your IoT device:
 * Create a new Device, use *Symmetric Key* authentication and let the system to
   *Auto Generate Keys*.
 * Optionally you may also define a *Shared access policy*.

Then, open the lorawan-server web-administration and create an Backend Connector:
 * *URI* is the IoT Hub *Hostname* with the `mqtts://` prefix
 * *Published Topic* shall be `devices/{devaddr}/messages/events/`.
   The trailing slash is mandatory.
 * *Subscribe* shall be `devices/xxxxxxxx/messages/devicebound/#`.
 * *Received Topic* shall be `devices/{devaddr}/messages/devicebound/#`.

On the Authentication tab:
 * *Client ID* is the *Device ID*
 * *Auth* shall be set to *Shared Access Signature*
 * When authenticating using the device key:
   * *Name* shall be empty
   * *Password/Key* is the device *Primary key* (encoded using Base64)
 * When authenticating using a *Shared access policy*:
   * *Name* is the *Access policy name*
   * *Password/Key* is the access policy *Primary key* (encoded using Base64)


## Adafruit IO

AdafruitIO supports MQTT and MQTT/SSL. Before doing the integration, make sure
you consult the following Adafruit articles:

 * [Adafruit IO](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io)
 * [Adafruit IO Basics: Feeds](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io-basics-feeds)
 * [Adafruit IO Basics: Dashboards](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io-basics-dashboards)
 * [MQTT, AdafruitIO & You!](https://learn.adafruit.com/mqtt-adafruit-io-and-you)

Once your Adafruit account, dashboards and feeds are set up, go to the
lorawan-server web-administration and create a Backends->Connector:
 * *URI* - `mqtt://io.adafruit.com` or `mqtts://io.adafruit.com`.
 * *Published Topic* - Name of the topic you will be publishing to in the form
   `YourUserName/feeds/YourFeed`.
 * *Subscribe* - Name of the topic you want to receive data from in the form
   `YourUserName/feeds/YourFeed`.

On the Authentication tab:
 * *Client ID* - can be anything, but try to keep it unique among connectors.
 * *Auth* should be set to *Username+Password*:
   * *Name* - Your Adafruit account name (see the last article in the list above).
   * *Password/Key* - Your Adafruit Key, NOT your account password (see above).

Adafruit supports only a single value feeds, so it is a _limitation_, if your mote sends multiple values in one packet. Also, Adafruit
IO expects the payload of the MQTT message to be a proper JSON of the form { "value": data } (ex. {"value": 23.5}). To achieve that
you need to create a Handler with the `Format` field set to `Raw Data`, `Connector` field set to your Connector and `Parse Uplink`
function with the code to parse your sensor data and create a JSON string expected by Adafruit.

This example function expects that the sensor is sending 16 bits of humidity, 16 bits of temperature (in tenths of a degree) and 1 byte checksum. It uses only temperature, because, as stated above, Adafruit feeds are single value. Temperature sign is encoded in the 16th bit.

```
fun(_Port, <<_Humid:16, Temp0:16, _Csum>>) -> # Point 1
TSign = Temp0 band 16#8000, # Point 2
TVal = Temp0 band 16#7FFF, # Point 3
case TSign of # Point 4
  0 -> Temp = TVal / 10;
  _ -> Temp = -(TVal / 10)
end,
[H|_] = io_lib:format("~w", [Temp]), # Point 5
 <<"{\"value\":", (list_to_binary(H))/bytes, "}">> # Point 6
end.
```

What this code does:
1. Parse the data packet from the sensor into three fields: Humid, Temp0 and Csum. 16-bit, big-endian. Humid and Csum are not used,
so their names are prefixed with _ sign.
2. Get the sign indication (+/-) from the temperature value.
3. Strip off the sign indication from the temperature value.
4. According to the sign indication, get the temperature value in degrees instead of their tenths.
5. io_lib:format() function converts a given value into text representation, but returns a list. So, as we have only one value, we
take the first element of its result and drop everything else, resulting our value being a proper stringlist (H).
6. Build the resulting binary value to be sent to Adafruit IO: `{"value": temperature}`.

After all of this is ready, you need to select this Handler as a *Group* on your
*Devices* or *Nodes* configuration page. And **don't forget** to set your *Application*
field to **backend** there.
